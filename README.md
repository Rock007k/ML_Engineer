#Hello Devzery Team,

Here I made a project for the section which is the part of assessment for the Machine Learning Internship.

I use python for the backend via Django. You have to create clone of this repo. in your system and make sure you have already installed django in your system and run manage.py file on the server .

In my project i mainly focused on the backend process and remains its frontend just normal HTML. 
After running server my login page will send a conformation mail to the user mail for the conformation. 
and after successfull conformation its gets login into the web application.
